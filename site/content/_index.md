    heading: My background
    text: I grew up in a small town in Alabama and hated it, so I joined the military at 17, saw the world, and loved it. During my years in the service, I always had a laptop with me and was always interested in programming, after my 8 years I left and am currently pursuing a career in development. I am working towards my degree but I am always brushing up on my skills as a developer, I am currently a software engineer at Firefly Integrations working on mobile applications however, I would like to make the switch to web development.
