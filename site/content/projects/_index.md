      Using React, Firebase, Stripe, and Axios, I have developed and deployed
      a basic working e-commerce website that mimics (to a lesser degree)
      what the Amazon store does. Complete with user registration, authentication,
      card payment, and asynchronous tasks.

       Developed, improved, and maintained the Mira and Eclipse apps for Firefly Integrations. 
       Working with the CAN bus and many different CAN messages to give 
       users the ability to control several different systems in their 
       individual RV. Some systems include HVAC, power, lighting, slides, awnings, tanks, etc. 
       Several bigger projects required reverse engineering to properly integrate functionality and statuses.
